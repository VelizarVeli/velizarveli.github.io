                        <h1>Scientific Method</h1>

                        <p>Our methods of thinking help us choose between formulations, ideas, thoughts, notions, hypotheses and theories. They enable us to decide what is true and what is false. They should also help us pick the most reliable action that offers maximum predictability and should allow us to reject ideas that do not correspond with observable facts.</p>
                        <p>Humans have used various methods of thinking including appealing to authority, intuition, and rational, philosophical and logical thinking. Using all of the above and more may be useful in coming up with creative ideas but we should not misuse these methods by relying on them to make a final selection. Most useful ideas are discovered when checking whether a verbal formulation corresponds with observable facts.</p>
                        <p>The enormous progress of science and the technological marvels of our age were possible because people tested their ideas against observable facts. What would make the big difference is the thorough insistence that all knowledge passes the test of being checked by observation. Sometimes this means tests, and sometimes it only means opening our eyes to observe facts that have been around us for years.</P>
